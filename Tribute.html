    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>General Bipin Rawat was a highly decorated and respected officer in the Indian Army. 
      He served as the Chief of Army Staff from December 2016 until December 2019. 
      During his tenure, he played a crucial role in modernizing the Indian Army and transforming it into a more agile, responsive, and technologically advanced force.

      General Rawat was born in Pauri Garhwal district of Uttarakhand in March 1958. 
      He was commissioned into the 5th Battalion of the 11th Gorkha Rifles in December 1978. 
      Over the course of his career, he served in a variety of operational and staff roles, including as a Company Commander in the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) in Sri Lanka, Brigade Commander in the Kashmir Valley, and General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) of the Eastern Command.</p>

          General Rawat was known for his no-nonsense approach and strong leadership skills. 
          He was a vocal advocate for military modernization and restructuring, and under his leadership, the Indian Army made significant progress in areas such as jointness, cyber warfare, and space-based assets.
           He also focused on enhancing the welfare and well-being of soldiers and their families.

          In December 2019, General Rawat was appointed as the first Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) of India, a new post created to oversee the integration and coordination of the three branches of the Indian armed forces.
          As CDS, he continued to champion military modernization and jointness, and also played a key role in the Indian government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
          
          Tragically, General Rawat passed away in a helicopter crash in December 2021, along with his wife and several other military personnel.
          He will be remembered as a visionary leader and a dedicated soldier who served his country with distinction and honor.</p>
